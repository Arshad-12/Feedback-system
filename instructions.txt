TO RUN:

FEEDBACK-NEW/backend -> node server.js (starts backend)
FEEDBACK-NEW -> npm start


------------------------------

GIT commands to do in vs code:

1. VS CODE -> GITHUB WEB

check status : git status

git add tt3.txt          #goes to staging
git commit -m "Created a new file called tt3.txt"    #commits to git
git push origin main     #goes to web github too

# if we make any changes to the same file, follow the same 3 commands.
# if you delete the file, do the same 3 commands after deletion.

---------------------------

2. GITHUB WEB -> VS CODE

I changed in github, i want the same change to reflect in vs code

git pull

----------------------------

<<<<<<>>>>>------------------<<<<<<>>>>>>

3. CREATE A FILE IN VS CODE -> PUT IN GITHUB

---- git init -> creates an init  file in vs code

if required, there are warnings, create a .gitignore file in vs code by 
just clicking create new file on left side bar.



git status (U)

git add file_name (lets you put every file name instead lets add all the files altogether)

---- git add . (all files will be added  simultaneously)

git status ( green color)

---- git commit -m "commit message"

create a repository in github named this -such that you can push files to that
specific repository. take the link of that repository by clicking "Code"

then come to vs code and connect that repository here.

---- git remote add origin https://github.com/preethi-p86/feedback_website.git

now use command,

---- git branch

it will show * master (master and main are same only)

rename master to main

---- git branch -M main

now check git branch command again,

git branch

it will show * main now.

now it can easily get pushed, use the command

---- git push origin main

---------

if you gave a wrong link earlier, and now you'd like to change it, then use this command

---- git remote set-url origin https://github.com/preethi-p86/Feedback-new.git (corrected link)

then check whether it's changed or not, using

---- git remote -v

then, 

---- git push origin main


----------------------------------

New branch creating

---- git branch -a (shows all the branches)

let us create a new branch in git, but it won't be showed in local system 
unless we run this command

---- git pull

---- git branch -a (the branch you are in shows in green colour)

to move to another branch,

---- git checkout branch_name

you can do the same process and add the new updated files to this branch.

to check the difference between both the files, we use

---- git diff branch_name (eg: if u are in main branch, use command, git diff 2nd_branch)
